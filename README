Generic Monitor XFce4 panel plugin (GenMon)
===========================================


1 -	Description
	-----------
The GenMon plugin cyclically spawns the indicated script/program, captures its output and displays the result into the panel.


2 -	Installation
	------------
Do the usual stuff:
	- gunzip
	- tar xf
	- ./configure --prefix=<XFce4InstallationDir>	(e.g. /usr/local)
	- make
	- make install  (as root)
	
You should then end up with:
        xfce4-genmon-plugin
installed in <XFce4InstallationDir>/libexec/xfce4/panel-plugins/
and
        genmon.desktop
installed in <XFce4InstallationDir>/share/xfce4/panel-plugins/

        xfce4-genmon-plugin.mo
installed in <XFce4InstallationDir>/share/locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/
where XX represents the languages supported by genmon plugin

3 -	Testing
	-------

Use GenMon for invoking the provided "datetime" shell script.
Then the current date/time should be continuously updated in your panel.

If the plugin displays XXX it means that the spawn of the command has failed.

4 -	Extra
	-----

A simple Perl script, disktemp, that retrieves the temperature of a disk
using the smartmontools is provided.
To install it, as root you may do:
	- cp disktemp /usr/local/bin
	- cd /usr/local/bin
	- chown root:root	disktemp
	- chmod a+rx		disktemp
	- chmod u+s 		disktemp
Then run (you need to have smartd/smarctl installed on your system)
	- disktemp <disk>	(e.g. /dev/hda)
If this works, you should be able to use GenMon for continually monitoring
your disk temperature.

5 -	New Features
	-----------

The new version of genmon plugin can also display an icon (which can be a
clickable icon), a tooltip, a text and a bar.

To display these items, the script called by genmon should return a simple
XML string.

The XML tags which can be used are :
<txt>Text to display</txt>
<img>Path to the image to display</img>
<tool>Tooltip text</tool>
<bar>Pourcentage to display in the bar</bar>
<click>The command to be executed when clicking on the image</click>

If None of the tags are detected in the result of the command, the plugin
returns to its original behaviour (displaying the result of the command).

No tag is mandatory: for instance, you can display a tooltip without and image...

The text between the <txt> and </txt> tag can use pango markup for style and color.

Here's a simple example of a plugin displaying the Temp of the CPU in the panel
(with an icon) and the Freq in a Tooltip:

#!/bin/bash
echo "<img>/usr/share/icons/Bluecurve/16x16/apps/gnome-monitor.png</img>"

declare -i cpuFreq
cpuFreq=$(cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "cpu MHz" | sed 's/\ \ */ /g' | cut -f3 -d" " | cut -f1 -d".")

if [ $cpuFreq -ge 1000 ]
then
  cpu=$(echo $cpuFreq | cut -c1).$(echo $cpuFreq | cut -c2)GHz
else
  cpu=${cpuFreq}MHz
fi
echo "<txt>"$(cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM/temperature | sed 's/\ \ */ /g' | cut -f2 -d" ")" C</txt>"
echo "<tool>Freq: "$cpu"</tool>"

PS: Depending on your configuration, you should change the image path.

You can find more scripts in scripts/mon*.
